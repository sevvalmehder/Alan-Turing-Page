		<p> Think a man. The man who change World Wat II’s fate. He is an Einstein of computer science. And he passes for the father of artificial intelligence even his death. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/timelines/z8bgr82#z3pnsbk" target= "_blank">(1) </a> This unsung hero’s name is Alan Turing.  He was born 1912 in London. </p>

		<p>In 1936 when he was 24, he published an article. It name is “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungs problem”.<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf" target= "_blank">(2) </a> He reformulated Kurt Gödel's theorem and he demonstrated  mathematics will always has unanswerable problem. Also he invented the ‘Universal Machine’ that capable of perform any set of instructions. It is a draft of the modern computer. </p>

		<p>During World War II, he was a leading the government’s code-breaking department. During the war government of  German is using a machine of Enigma for communicating. And then he developed the new machine name is Bombe. And Bombe can break Enigma message. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/" target= "_blank">(3) </a> </p>

		<p>Till 1947, he worked on the design of Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) at the NPL. This machine can store programs in its memory. Unfortunately he left NPL before 1950. In his absence, the pilot ACE was made in 1950.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing" target="_blank">(4) </a>  In university of Manchester, he focused on the use of computer and he offered Turing Test. Turing Test will be an answer of the “Can computer capable of thinking like a human?” This was represent the beginning of artificial intelligence. Turing Test based on “Can people realize for machine or real person?” <a href="http://crl.ucsd.edu/~saygin/papers/MMTT.pdf" target="_blank">(5) </a> </p>

		<p>His last year, he was interested in mathematical biology. He published “The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in 1952.<a href="http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf" target="_blank"> (6) </a>  On June 8, 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the cause of cyanide poisoning the previous day.  He had committed suicide.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death" target="_blank">(7) </a> After his death he was honored in a number of other ways.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Awards_and_honours" >(8) </a> </p>
